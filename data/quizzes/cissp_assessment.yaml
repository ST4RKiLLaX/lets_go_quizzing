        text: An organization is migrating from a traditional perimeter security model to a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). Which change to their Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) strategy best aligns with this transition?
        options:
          - Expanding the DMZ to encompass cloud resources
          - Relying solely on edge firewalls for internal trust
          - Implementing micro-segmentation and identity-based access
          - Removing all network segmentation
        answer: 2

        text: How does the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) protocol in modern wireless networks improve upon previous security standards?
        options:
          - It hides the SSID from passive scanning
          - It uses a centralized authentication server for all keys
          - It relies entirely on MAC address filtering
          - It requires interactive cryptographic exchanges to prevent offline dictionary attacks
        answer: 3

        text: When deploying applications using OS-level virtualization (like LXC) instead of traditional virtual machines, what is the primary security concern?
        options:
          - A privilege escalation in the shared host kernel could compromise all containers
          - Containers cannot use encrypted storage volumes
          - Containers are completely incompatible with network segmentation
          - Containers bypass all identity and access management solutions

        text: A development team frequently forks open-source repositories and integrates pull requests into their proprietary software. Which control BEST mitigates the risk of a software supply chain attack?
        options:
          - Automated Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and vulnerability scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
          - Relying solely on the community reputation of the upstream project
          - Disabling automatic updates for all third-party libraries
          - Requiring legal indemnification from open-source contributors

        text: Under the cloud shared responsibility model in an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, which task remains the sole responsibility of the cloud customer?
        options:
          - Patching the guest operating systems of deployed virtual instances
          - Securing the physical hypervisor infrastructure
          - Managing the environmental controls of the data center
          - Replacing failed storage drives in the underlying array

        text: During an active ransomware incident, the response team decides to logically isolate affected network segments rather than immediately powering off the infected servers. What is the primary justification for this decision?
        options:
          - To allow the encryption to finish so a decryption key can be purchased
          - To ensure backup servers remain accessible over the infected network
          - To preserve volatile memory (RAM) artifacts for forensic analysis
          - To trigger an automatic failover to the disaster recovery site
        answer: 2

        text: When implementing Federated Identity Management between two distinct organizations using SAML, what role does the Identity Provider (IdP) primarily serve?
        options:
          - It consumes the authentication assertion to grant access to a resource
          - It authenticates the user and generates a digitally signed assertion
          - It encrypts the network tunnel between the two organizations
          - It stores the authorization permissions for the Service Provider's application
        answer: 1

        text: To comply with modern privacy frameworks, an organization replaces direct identifiers in a dataset with artificial identifiers. The mapping table is stored securely in a separate location. Which technique has been applied?
        options:
          - Data masking
          - Anonymization
          - Tokenization
          - Pseudonymization

        text: Which cryptographic concept ensures that the compromise of a server's long-term private key does not compromise the confidentiality of past captured session keys?
        options:
          - Perfect Forward Secrecy
          - Asymmetric Encryption
          - Digital Signatures
          - Key Escrow

        text: An organization wants to test its disaster recovery plan by activating the alternate site and processing real-world data transactions, but without shutting down the primary site. Which type of test is this?
        options:
          - Tabletop exercise
          - Full interruption test
          - Parallel test
          - Simulation test
        answer: 2
